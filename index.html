   <h4>Before you judge others or claim any absolute truth, consider this...</h4>
       <p><strong>...you can see less than 1%</strong> of the electromagnetic<br>
       spectrum and hear less than 1% of the acoustic<br>
       spectrum. <strong>As you read this, you are</strong> traveling at 220<br>
       kilometres per second across the galaxy.<strong>90% of the <br>
       cells in your body</strong> carry their own microbial DNA<br>
       and are not "you". <strong>The atoms in your body are</strong><br>
       99.9999999999999999% empty space and none of them<br>
       are the ones you were born with, but they all<br>
       originated in the belly of a star. <strong>Humans beings have<br>
       46</strong> chromosomes, 2 less than the common potato.<br>
       <strong>The existance of the rainbow</strong> depends on the conical<br>
       photoreceptors in your eyes; to animals without cones,<br>
       the rainbow does not exist. <strong>So you don't just look</strong> at a<br>
       rainbow, you create it. <strong>This is pretty amazing,</strong> especially<br>
       considering that all the beautiful colors you see represent<br>
       less than 1% of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
